This section focuses on the first step in any data analysis project: **exploring the data.**

You can use descriptive methods to: 
- Understand the _spread_ and _shape_ of your data, 
- Characterize any _central tendency_ of your data, 
- See unusual data values or patterns in your data (_anomaly detection_).
